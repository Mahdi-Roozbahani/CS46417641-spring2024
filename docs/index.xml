      <description>Categories#Assignments (50%)#There will be four assignments. Each one is designed to improve and test your understanding of the materials. Assignments will have both programming and written analysis components.
We have 4 big assignments in total. The reason we do not call them projects is because our class has a project as well. Consider each assignment as one individual big project. Assignments take time to finish them.</description>

      <description>Course Overview#Important
CSE students should note that CS 7641 is not allowed as a substitute for the CSE core course CSE 6740, and that they cannot get credit for both CSE 6740 and CS 7641.This course introduces techniques in machine learning with an emphasis on algorithms and their applications to real-world data. We will investigate the following question: how to computationally extract useful knowledge from data for decision making and task support!</description>

      <description>General#Attendance#Our class will be offered on campus for both Undergrad (4641) and Grad (7641). Lectures might be recorded IF class has the recording system. Any class that I am able to record [which sometimes does not work even if we have the recording system in place], I will make it available to all students (both undergrad and grad) by the end of the day. The attendance is required for both undergrad and grad.</description>

      <description>Office Hours#Overview#Office hours will start on the second week of clases in a hybrid mode for both online and in-person. Please follow the instruction on this Excel Sheet [Grad|Undergrad] ​to signup for a 10-minutes slot with one of the TAs. If you require more than ten minutes, please advise the TAs. They’ll return to your Zoom meeting once they have completed their appointments with other students.</description>

      <description>Project Breakdown#The course semester long project is worth 30% of your grade, and is composed of the parts below
Proposal (5%)#A project proposal should be written on your GitHub page. It is also a good starter to come up with the first draft of your project.
You need to provide us the link to your GitHub page. Make sure your GitHub repository is private.
It should be less than 500 words single spaced.</description>

      <description>Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion#Just as machine learning algorithms cannot accomplish complex tasks if trained on datasets of limited variability, our course cannot be successful without appreciating the diversity of our students. In this class we aim to create an environment where all voices are valued, respecting the diversity of gender, sexuality, age, socioeconomic status, ability, ethnicity, race, and culture. We always welcome suggestions that can help us achieve this goal.</description>
