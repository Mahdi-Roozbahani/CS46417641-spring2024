      <description>Categories # Assignments (50%) # There will be four assignments. Each one is designed to improve and test your understanding of the materials. Assignments will have both programming and written analysis components.&#xA;We have 4 big assignments in total. The reason we do not call them projects is because our class has a project as well. Consider each assignment as one individual big project. Assignments take time to finish them.</description>
