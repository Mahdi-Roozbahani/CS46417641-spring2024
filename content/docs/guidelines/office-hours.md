# Office Hours

## Overview

Office hours will start on the second week of clases in a hybrid mode for both online and in-person. Please follow the instruction on this Excel Sheet ​to signup for a 10-minutes slot with one of the TAs. If you require more than ten minutes, please advise the TAs. They’ll return to your Zoom meeting once they have completed their appointments with other students. You just need to add your name, question of interest and your Zoom meeting link. Please do not change the other part of the Excel Sheet.

The TA meetings are designed to be one-on-one. Please do not join another student’s Zoom meeting. The sole exception to this policy being discussions about the project, in which your fellow team members can also join.

In-person office hours location will be updated on the OH Excel Sheet for each TA.

## Rules and Guidelines

There are two types of slots in the Office Hour Spreadsheet: **reserved slots** and **waitlist slots**

- **Reserved Slots**: Students are allowed to hold ONE pending reserved time slot at any time.
  - Let’s say it’s Tuesday night. Student A signs up for a Wednesday OH slot from 10:00–10:10 AM. Now, student A may NOT put their name on any other reserved time slot. Once the 10:00–10:10 AM OH session has finished, then student A may sign up for another available reserved OH time slot.
  - There is no limit to how many OH sessions a student can attend, but we require you to hold only one active/pending reserved time slot at a time.
- **Waitlist slots**: You are allowed to sign up for multiple waitlist slots per day, but you can only sign up for one slot per TA session.
  - At the start of the TAs OH, if there are regular OH slots available and students on the waitlist, the TA may bump up the waitlisted student to one of the open reserved OH slots.
  - If there are no reserved slots available, a TA may assign an estimated time slot or take the student based on their availability. It is possible that a TA cannot get to any or all of the students on a waitlist.

We have these rules in place so that students can get additional OH help if needed and also to allow availability to a larger subset of students once OH gets busier closer to HW deadlines.
